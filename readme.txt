=2.How do I know the MyEffecto Emotional Feedback Emoticon set I have chosen are the right ones?=
	
	We have made it as easy as possible for you to get the right Emoticon set. 
	Each emoticon set has been classified for a variety of editorial content product launches, product reviews, opinion pieces, features stories, profiles, news reports, photo-features, recipes, new appointments, financial result announcements and whole bunch of stuff. 
	So whether you are putting together your own original content or curated content across sports, fashion, films, entertainment, business or any other category you will find a MyEffecto Feedback Emotion set suitable to your need.
	
	You have to work on your best judgement based on the sets provided and try them out. 
	Ultimately, the feedback you receive will primarily be a function of your content and your audience. 
	We recommend trying out different sets if your original set is not working. You may also customize your own Emoticon set.

=3.Can I change the MyEffecto Emotional Feedback Emoticon Set at any point in time?=
	
	Absolutely. The MyEffecto Emotional Feedback Emoticon Set is completely based on the choice of the author and publisher.

	However, the data around the earlier emoticon set will be lost.
	
=4.Does a user or reader need to be signed in to provide feedback?=	
	
	At the moment, the user does not need to be signed in to provide feedback. 
	If he chooses to share the article on his social network (option available for Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin) he will then need to sign in to his social network account and no a MyEffecto account or yours to do so.

=5.How can I be sure that the feedback mechanism can’t be gamed?=

	We ensure one can only click on the MyEffecto Feedback once. For the moment, he cannot undo his choice.
	
=6.Many of my readers may read the entire article, do you have an option wherein I can display the widget adjacent to the article or in any other fashion that can capture feedback whenever they stopped reading?=	

	Not at the moment. We are working on it.
	
=7.I have finished reading the article, however the MyEffecto Widget has still not loaded.=

	MyEffecto Emotional Feedback Widget loads simultaneously with other widgets and usually loads instantly. 
	However, since the widget is being served from our (third-party) server and not yours, there may be instances where the widget will have a delayed appearance.

	Nothing to worry about. Simply refresh the page. If the problem persists, please write to us at (support@myeffecto.com)

=11.How does MyEffecto recommend articles to my reader?=	

	While at the moment, MyEffecto uses only simple ‘most rated’ mechanisms to push content recommendation; it will use a far sophisticated approach to drive recommendation once the data available with us crosses a certain threshold.
	The recommendation will be based on a proprietary algorithm involving the user feedback, category of the articles, the users behavior, general audience behavior and many other such factors.
