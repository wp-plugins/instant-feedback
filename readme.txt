== Description ==

With MyEffecto's Emotional Feedback widget, get Instant, Visual, Measurable emotional
response for your blog posts. Capture the unsaid expressions between 'Likes' and Comments.
Improve engagement and see the analytics through a dashboard. Simply select a list of 
emotions from a library we provide and add the plugin to your content and your viewers 
respond you what they feel. Allow readers to share articles by tagging the articles as per
their feedback automatically. Display recommended articles (based on the feedback clicked 
and other behavioural elements) through an in-site content recommendation engine. 
Example: If you provide "WOW" as a feedback button to your reader and he clicks it, 
he can share this articles n say Twitter "WOW- Eg: Dalai Lama wins Time Person of the 
Year award <url> via @myeffecto". Instantly, he also sees MyEffecto Recommended articles
 that are best suited to him that also have a WOW tag.  

How MyEffecto helps you:

1.	**Create custom emotional feedback button sets for specific blog posts:**
	The author of the post can specifically choose which MyEffecto emotional feedback set 
	she would like to have for each particular post. To get the most suitable reply, 
	she can also frame the right question along with the emoticon feedback set.

2.	**Capture instant, visual and measurable feedback from your readers:** 
	Likes tend to be uni-dimensional and don't really capture the flavor of the feedback. 
	Comments, on the other hand, need moderation. They can also be too tedious to write or 
	one may see comment threads go in a direction that is absolutely off-topic. 
	MyEffecto helps you capture a range of expressions - on how they feel -
	which no other feedback mechanism captures.

3.	**Increase reader engagement:** 
	Barely 1% of readers give any sort of feedback to posts and articles. 
	Our early trials have seen this number go upto 20%.  
	If the emotion placed resonates well with the audience, 
	the feedback capture is higher among click happy readers.

4.	**Increase time spent on site by audience:** 
	2 minutes is the average time spent on a media site or blog by a reader. 
	By providing recommended reads based on the feedback readers have provided 
	on a particular post, the widget encourages readers to read relevant articles 
	and thereby increase time spent on site.

5.	**Get emotion tagged articles v/s keyword tagged articles:** 
	Get audience tagged content based on the outcome of the article. 
	The effect of such articles where audience say that it made them feel 'happy' 
	or 'sad' may not necessarily be captured through keywords in the posts.

6.	**Get insightful engagement analytics:** 
	While pageviews could happen due to multiple reasons, 
	Myeffecto you get a dashboard that helps you get insightful engagement analytics 
	based on the feedback readers provided -  what content gets most feedback, 
	what time of day is best for highest feedback, what percentage of 
	readers provided feedback.

We have made it as easy as possible for you to get the right Emoticon set. 
Each emoticon set has been classified for a variety of editorial content product launches, 
product reviews, opinion pieces, features stories, profiles, news reports, photo-features, 
recipes, new appointments, financial result announcements and whole bunch of stuff.

on the sets provided and try them out.Ultimately, the feedback you receive will primarily be a 
function of your content and your audience. 
We recommend trying out different sets if your original set is not working. 
You may also customize your own Emoticon set.

3.	**Can I change the MyEffecto Emotional Feedback Emoticon Set at any point in time?**
Absolutely. The MyEffecto Emotional Feedback Emoticon Set is completely based on the 
choice of the author and publisher.
However, the data around the earlier emoticon set will be lost.

4.	**Does a user or reader need to be signed in to provide feedback?**
At the moment, the user does not need to be signed in to provide feedback. 
If he chooses to share the article on his social network 
(options available for Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin) 
he will then need to sign in to his social network account 
(and not a MyEffecto account or yours) to do so.

5.	**How can I be sure that the feedback mechanism can't be gamed?**
We ensure one can only click on the MyEffecto Feedback once. 
For the moment, he cannot undo his choice.

6. **Many of my readers may read the entire article, do you have an option 
wherein I can display the widget adjacent to the article or in any other fashion that can 
capture feedback whenever they stopped reading?**
Not at the moment. We are working on it.

7.	**I have finished reading the article, however the MyEffecto Widget has still not loaded.**
MyEffecto Emotional Feedback Widget loads simultaneously with other widgets and usually loads instantly. 
However, since the widget is being served from our (third-party) server and not yours, 
there may be instances where the widget will have a delayed appearance.

3.	**What is the information I can get through MyEffecto Engagement analytics?**
Till the time we enable login based posting, you can view the following data :

*	Pageviews per post  (Unique and otherwise)

*	Overall pageviews (Unique and otherwise)

Nothing to worry about. Simply refresh the page. If the problem persists,
please write to us at support@myeffecto.com

6.	**How does MyEffecto recommend articles to my reader?**
While at the moment, MyEffecto uses only simple 'most rated' mechanisms to push content recommendation; 
it will use a far sophisticated approach to drive recommendation once the data available with us 
crosses a certain threshold. The recommendation will be based on a proprietary algorithm 
involving the user feedback, category of the articles, 
the users behavior, general audience behavior and many other such factors.
