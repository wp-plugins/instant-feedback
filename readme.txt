This plugin gives customized and interactive feedback for your blog.

== Description ==

How MyEffecto helps you:

= Create custom emotional feedback button sets for specific blog posts: =
	The author of the post can specifically choose which MyEffecto emotional feedback set she would like to have for each particular post.
	To get the most suitable reply, she can also frame the right question along with the emoticon feedback set.

= Capture instant, visual and measurable feedback from your readers: =
	 Likes tend to be uni-dimensional and doesn’t really capture the flavor of the feedback. Comments, on the other hand, need moderation. 
	 They can also be too tedious to fill or may see comment threads go in a direction that is absolutely off-topic.
	 MyEffecto helps you capture a range of expression –  = on how they feel = - which no other feedback mechanism can capture.

= Increase reader engagement: =	
	Barely 1% of readers give any sort of feedback to posts and articles. Our early trials have seen this number go upto 20%. 
	If the emotion placed resonates well with the audience, the feedback capture is higher among the click happy customers.

= Increase time spent on site by audience: =	
	2 minutes is the average time spent on a media site or blog by a reader. 
	By providing recommended reads based on the feedback readers have provided on a particular post,
	the widget encourages readers to read similarly tagged articles and thereby increase time spent on site.
	
= Get emotion tagged articles v/s keyword tagged articles: =	
	Get audience tagged content based on the outcome of the article.
	The effect of such articles where audience say that it made them feel ‘happy’ or ‘sad’ may not 
	necessarily be captured through keywords in the posts.

= Get insightful engagement analytics: While pageviews could happen due to multiple reasons, =
	Myeffecto you get a dashboard that helps you get insightful engagement analytics based on the feedback readers provided 
	-  what content gets most feedback, what time of day is best for highest feedback, what percentage of readers provided feedback. 
	
This is an offical MyEffecto plugin that lets you embed the Javascript integration code into your pages.

	At the moment, the user does not need to be signed in to provide feedback. 
	If he chooses to share the article on his social network (option available for Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin)
	he will then need to sign in to his social network account and no a MyEffecto account or yours to do so.

= 5.How can I be sure that the feedback mechanism can’t be gamed? =

	We ensure one can only click on the MyEffecto Feedback once. For the moment, he cannot undo his choice.
	
= 6.Many of my readers may read the entire article, do you have an option wherein I can display the widget adjacent
 to the article or in any other fashion that can capture feedback whenever they stopped reading? =	

	Not at the moment. We are working on it.
	
= 7.I have finished reading the article, however the MyEffecto Widget has still not loaded. =

	MyEffecto Emotional Feedback Widget loads simultaneously with other widgets and usually loads instantly. 
	However, since the widget is being served from our (third-party) server and not yours, 
	there may be instances where the widget will have a delayed appearance.

	Nothing to worry about. Simply refresh the page. If the problem persists, please write to us at (support@myeffecto.com)

= 11.How does MyEffecto recommend articles to my reader? =	

	While at the moment, MyEffecto uses only simple ‘most rated’ mechanisms to push content recommendation;
	it will use a far sophisticated approach to drive recommendation once the data available with us crosses a certain threshold.
	The recommendation will be based on a proprietary algorithm involving the user feedback, category of the articles,
	the users behavior, general audience behavior and many other such factors.
